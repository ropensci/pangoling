\title{Unload a masked language model and free memory}
\usage{
masked_unload()
}
\value{
Nothing (called for side effects).
}
\description{
Unloads a masked language model and its tokenizer from memory, and triggers
garbage collection to free up RAM and GPU memory.
}
\details{
This function helps manage memory when working with large models. It:
\itemize{
\item Deletes the model and tokenizer objects from Python
\item Empties the CUDA cache (if using GPU)
\item Triggers garbage collection in both Python and R
}

It's particularly useful when:
\itemize{
\item Switching between different models
\item Working with limited memory
\item Running multiple models sequentially
}
}
\examples{
\dontshow{if (installed_py_pangoling()) (if (getRversion() >= "3.4") withAutoprint else force)(\{ # examplesIf}
# Load a model
masked_preload(model = "bert-base-uncased")

# Do some work...
pred <- masked_targets_pred(
  prev_contexts = "The cat", 
  targets = "sat",
  after_contexts = "down",
  model = "bert-base-uncased"
)

# Unload when done
masked_unload()
\dontshow{\}) # examplesIf}
