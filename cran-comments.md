## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. 

In this version I have I set the OMP_THREAD_LIMIT to 1.

Previous CRAN incoming feasibility resulted in two NOTES.

---------
1. Possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION. 
But these should be fine.
----------
2. Installation took CPU time 3.1 times elapsed time in Debian.

I couldn't replicate the problem Rhub's debian. But in any case, I followed the suggestion of setting OMP THREAD LIMIT (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77323811/r-package-to-cran-had-cpu-time-5-times-elapsed-time).


## R CMD check results
